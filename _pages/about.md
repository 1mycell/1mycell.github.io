I'm a fourth year Ph.D. student from Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science (AMSS), Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interest includes the intersection of economics, finance, and artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on Large Language Models (LLMs).

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yongmiao Hong from Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
