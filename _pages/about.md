I'm a fourth year Ph.D. student from [Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science (AMSS)](http://english.amss.cas.cn), Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interest includes **the intersection of AI, finance, and economics, with a particular focus on Large Language Model Agents.**

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yongmiao Hong](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~ymhong?language=en) from Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

I’m convinced that impactful research emerges through interdisciplinary collaboration, and I would be delighted to explore potential project partnerships with you.

### 2.Price Limit Information and Stock Market Prediction in China: A New Perspective Through Image Recognition

Proposes LCNN and PCNN methods that visualize China A-share price-limit information as images for prediction. Empirical results show models incorporating visualized price-limit data significantly outperform traditional factor models in both accuracy and portfolio returns. Validates the unique value of "visualizing" institutional information for quantitative prediction.

### 3.Nowcasting and Decomposing Macroeconomic Risk via Business News and Large Language Model

Introduces Risk-LLM framework that extracts high-frequency signals from economic news via zero-shot learning, embedded in the Growth-at-Risk model for macroeconomic risk measurement and decomposition. Substantially outperforms sentiment-dictionary benchmarks, especially during volatile periods, and more effectively identifies indirect effects in news. Fully replicable and adaptable to future LLM advances.

### 4.When Large Language Model Meets Economic News: Advancing Narrative-Driven Macroeconomic Forecasting and Nowcasting

Proposes Target-LLM method that extracts multidimensional information from economic news through well-designed zero-shot prompts for macro prediction. Combines strengths of topic modeling and sentiment lexicon approaches, significantly outperforming traditional methods in forecasting US GDP, inflation, and unemployment. Constructed impact strength indicators provide more timely and accurate nowcasting performance.
